# Assignment 3 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment completes our movie chatbot system by implementing action functions that query our movie database and building a natural language interface. You implemented functions to search for movies by year, director, and actors, as well as the core search system that matches user queries to appropriate database operations. This builds directly on the pattern matching work from Assignment 2 to create a functional conversational AI system.

## What to complete
1. Complete all action functions in `a3.py` (title_by_year, title_by_year_range, etc.)
2. Implement the `search_pa_list` function to handle pattern matching and responses  
3. Add at least one new movie to the database with proper formatting
4. Create a new pattern/action pair and add it to the pa_list
5. Ensure all provided assert statements pass
6. Complete the reflection questions below
7. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions

1. What are some key programming concepts or techniques that you learned while completing this assignment?
Some key programming concepts I learned while completing this assignment by learning how to add more movies or information to a database and how patterns and sources work together.



2. How does the overall movie chatbot system work? Explain the flow from when a user types a query to when they receive an answer.
Basically how the movie chatbot system work by having a matching system where it matches the words it already knows, and then the _s and the %s are the prompts the user sends to the chatbot and the chatbot goes through a database to find what the user's 



3. What are some real-world applications where this type of pattern-matching chatbot system could be useful? How might you extend or improve this system for practical use?
One real world applications where this pattern-matching chatbot can be useful is possibly with ordering food on a kiosk for example asking the robot what are nutrional values from whatever your ordering. How I might extend or improve this system for practical list is by changing it from movies to
